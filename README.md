## Raspberry Pi Miniature Car

The hardware is pretty much complete, and it can drive. The software needs much more work. At this time, I'm not doing anything with the data collected by the sensors. The next step is to use the data collected to track location.  

The car has a camera, four ultrasonic sensors, a USB GPS, bluetooth, wifi, attitude sensor, barometric pressure sensor and... a button.
